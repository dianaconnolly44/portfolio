TO PUBLISH:

IN TERMINAL (TAB #1 - no the tab with localhost running)â€¦

git add .; git commit -m "____"
___  = labels/describes the new addition (make sure to include quotes around it)

npm run deploy

(If aborts and asks to commit changes, do step one of "TO PUBLISH")

(If completes pull but shows a screen saying "Merge..." Type anywhere: :wq)
