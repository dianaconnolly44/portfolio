    <p>The above flyers were created for <a href="https://djcherishtheluv.com/" target="_blank">DJ Cherish the Luv</a>'s "Cancer in a Jar" pediatric workshop, in which she 
    shares her therapeutic tactic of visualizing one's cancer outside of the body as an entity separate from oneself. 
    Participants create a physical manifestation of their cancer out of craft materials, and put in a jar to help them 
    identify and separate from their cancer.</p>

// worked with the rabbi to developed visual 
    //symbols to represent each of the prayers in the Shabbat in order to guide the members 
    //with ASD through the ceremony. These symbols will be presented to the members via a 
    //large banner on the temple’s stage as well as on personal bookmarks that correspond 
    //with the banner. The bookmarks will also have a sticker packet with the symbols printed 
    //as stickers, to be placed on each of the corresponding sections for the current prayer 
    //on the bookmarks. The visually and physically interactive elements of these materials 
    //will help to add more sensorial aspects to the Shabbat, further benefitting Temple Sinai’s members with ASD.
