    <p>I created a suite of illustrations as part of <a href="https://www.gratadata.com/" target="_blank">Grata</a>'s new product launch, called the "Canis Major Release". Grata wanted their upcoming collection of releases to revolve around a theme of space and constellations, with this release focusing on the Canis Major constellation. I was tasked with creating illustrations for the release's logo image, email announcement image, and landing page images.</p>

// worked with the rabbi to developed visual 
    //symbols to represent each of the prayers in the Shabbat in order to guide the members 
    //with ASD through the ceremony. These symbols will be presented to the members via a 
    //large banner on the temple’s stage as well as on personal bookmarks that correspond 
    //with the banner. The bookmarks will also have a sticker packet with the symbols printed 
    //as stickers, to be placed on each of the corresponding sections for the current prayer 
    //on the bookmarks. The visually and physically interactive elements of these materials 
    //will help to add more sensorial aspects to the Shabbat, further benefitting Temple Sinai’s members with ASD.
