    <p>I created this piece during my interdisciplinary studies at Carnegie 
    Mellon University in the course <a href="https://www.phipps.conservatory.org/" target="_blank">52-392</a>, "BXA Seminar III: Deconstructing Disciplines". 
    This class was focused on the examination of different disciplines and where they may cross over. For my final project, 
    I wanted to further explore my interdisciplinary topic of beauty verses disgust. These are both psychological reactions one 
    has to stimulation such as visual input. To explore this topic, I wanted to create a sculpture that invoked both feelings of 
    beauty and disgust by using the visual of a spider, a form that triggers disgust for many humans, but make it beautiful by 
    mimicking a decorative brooch. Thus, I created a "spider brooch".</p>

// worked with the rabbi to developed visual 
    //symbols to represent each of the prayers in the Shabbat in order to guide the members 
    //with ASD through the ceremony. These symbols will be presented to the members via a 
    //large banner on the temple’s stage as well as on personal bookmarks that correspond 
    //with the banner. The bookmarks will also have a sticker packet with the symbols printed 
    //as stickers, to be placed on each of the corresponding sections for the current prayer 
    //on the bookmarks. The visually and physically interactive elements of these materials 
    //will help to add more sensorial aspects to the Shabbat, further benefitting Temple Sinai’s members with ASD.
