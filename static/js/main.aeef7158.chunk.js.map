The topic of this project involved research of 1) how to make the most effective\n    visual symbols for their intended audience, 2) user experience and user testing, 3) sensorial tools in aiding engagement of individuals on the Autism spectrum, \n    as well as pre-verbal aged children.</p>\n\n<div className=\"imgs max300\">\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/aboutTS/templeOutside.jpg')} />\n            <p>Temple Sinai, of Pittsburgh, PA</p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/aboutTS/templeInside.jpg')} />\n            <p>Temple Sinai's prayer room</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n        \n    <p>Temple Sinai in Pittsburgh, PA is a Jewish temple that works to be inclusive of all of its members. \n    One way in which they pursue this is by holding their Mostly Musical Shabbat, a monthly prayer ceremony \n    that utilizes the sensorial tools of singing and listening to music in order to best involve the temple \n    members with sensory needs, such as young audiences or those on the Autism spectrum. Sensorial tools such as these\n    have been shown to be especially beneficial to those with Autism Spectrum Disorder as involving different \n    senses is known to help these individuals engage attention.</p>\n\n<div className=\"imgs max300\">\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/aboutTS/demoMMS.jpg')} />\n            <p>A \"Mostly Musical Shabbat\" ceremony</p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/aboutTS/flyerMMS.jpg')} />\n            <p>Flyer for \"Mostly Musical Shabbat\"</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n        \n    <p>Temple Sinai’s rabbi and I connected when we agreed to collaborate on this Mostly Musical Shabbat. We discussed\n    incorporating additional sensorial elements in the shabbat, and this became the topic for which I dedicated my undergraduate thesis project. \n    To supplement the musical sensorial elements that the temple was already incorporating, I produced, tested, and iterated various \n    visual and interactive products to help maintain involvement during the ceremony from our target audiences.</p>\n\n\n\n\n    <h2> Ideation</h2>\n\n    <p> I met with the rabbi to first discuss the flow of the shabbat ceremony. We determined that the items needed were:\n    1) a \"visual schedule\" to help the audience members be aware of the overall flow and duration of the shabbat, \n    and 2) some form of tactile interactive object for members to engage with as the ceremony was proceeding.</p>\n\n    <p> The rabbi and I spliced the ceremony's flow into four main sections, and I learned from the rabbi the \n    contents and meanings of each prayer within these four ceremony sections. Separately, I continued my literature review \n    research on how to make effective symbols, and began to illustrate symbols to represent each shabbat prayer. \n    The rabbi and I iterated over the prayers' symbol library until we felt content with them.</p>\n\n<div className=\"imgs max300\">\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/doubleStickers.jpg')} />\n            <p>Prayer icon library</p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/iconExamples.jpg')} />\n            <p>Select example icons</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\n    <h2> Process</h2>\n\n    <p> Once the symbol library was complete, I began the first iterations of the two products. The \"visual schedule\" \n    was expressed as a 6-foot-tall banner to sit on the stage where the rabbi would be leading the ceremony. This banner \n    was used to denote the four ceremony sections, as well as all of the prayers in each section.</p>\n\n<div className=\"imgs max400\">\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/bannerStageOG.jpg')} />\n            <p>Banner on stage at Temple Sinai</p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/banner.jpg')} />\n            <p>Banner enlarged</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n    <p> The second product was an interactive sticker sheet, with one of each prayer icon printed on the stickers. The intended use of this\n    product was to follow along with each prayer, helping with engagement of the target audneice to comprehend: 1) the duration of the \n    ceremony, 2) which prayer was currently happening, and 3) the overall topic of the current prayer.</p>\n\n    <p>My first iteration of this product began as a \"bookmark\" to be placed in each audience member's torah book. \n    The bookmark had black and white labelled versions of each prayer, and the corresponding stickers were intended to be applied over \n    each prayer as it was occurring. I created this bookmark by designing and printing out sheets with all four ceremony\n    sections, and folding these sheets to expose only one section of the ceremony at a time. Each of these four sections were the same\n    as those denoted on the visual schedule on the temple's stage.</p>\n\n<div className=\"imgs max300\">\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/1/print1.jpg')} />\n            <p>Version 1, digital file</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <p>After receiving user feedback after the ceremony, I began planning my next iterations. Both the rabbi and the patrons expressed\n    great satisfaction with the banner. The bookmark, however, was not clear enough as to what interaction was expected to take place. Thus,\n    I created a larger bookmark with the stickers already on the bookmark, next to where the stickers should be place. I also included \n    on the bookmark more directions, such as numbering the order of the four ceremony sections as well as instructions on how to place the stickers.\n    This iteration can be viewed below.</p>\n\n<div className=\"imgs max300\">\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/2/print1.jpg')} />\n            <p>Digital print file</p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/2/1.jpeg')} />\n            <p>Pick-up spot before entering</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"imgs max300\">\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/2/2.jpeg')} />\n            <p>Physical demonstration</p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/2/4.jpeg')} />\n            <p>Physical demonstration</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n        \n\n    <p>I continued this process of user testing and user feedback for the remainder of my semester, until I came upon the final idea of\n    a \"sticker book\", in place of the bookmark idea. I was guided to this idea by the continued user feedback, as this seemed to be\n    the most intuitive format to express the progession of several different sections of the ceremony.</p>\n\n    <p>This book was separated by: 1) a cover image to express the topic of the book, 2) an instruction page to express the intended use, \n    3) one page per each section of the ceremony, and 4) a sheet of stickers, in order, for each prayer that would occur.</p>\n \n <div className=\"imgs max200\">\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/print1.jpg')} />\n            <p>Cover page</p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/doubleStickers.jpg')} />\n            <p>Prayer icon stickers</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n     <div className=\"imgs max200\">\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/print2.jpg')} />\n            <p>Instruction page, noting to place stickers on their respective spots</p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/print4.jpg')} />\n            <p>Example internal page, section 2 (\"sh'ma\") of the shabbat</p>\n        </div>\n        \n    </div>\n    \n    <div className=\"imgs max300\">\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/tableHandout.jpeg')} />\n            <p>Pick-up spot before entering</p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/bookPile.jpeg')} />\n            <p>Physical books</p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/demoSticker.jpeg')} />\n            <p>Physical book demonstration</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>  \n\n    <p>I was happy to see that this book had very positive effects at its final test run. It was not only helpful for the intended audience of\n    temple members with sensorial sensitivities, but also pre-verbal children, children too young to read, anyone with difficulty focusing \n    during the service, and anyone who could not read the Hebrew presented in the original prayer. During this final test ceremony, \n    children who had not received the book were noticing others enjoying it and ran to the lobby get their own book. I actually ran out of my\n    supply of books. After the ceremony, parents came over to me thrilled at how engaged their young children remained during the entire ceremony, and requested that this be applied to other events\n    as well. In addition, a boardmember of the Women of Reform Judaism (WRJ) requested that I share this product with the 800 temples \n    involved in her organization, as well as produce such content for similar audiences in other environments such as other ceremonies as well as Hebrew school.</p>\n\n\n\n\n    <div className=\"imgs max300\">\n       \n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/girl.jpeg')} />\n            <p>A young temple member and her grandmother using the sticker book</p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/bannerStageOG.jpg')} />\n            <p>Banner in use during ceremony</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n    <h2> Conclusion</h2>\n\n    <p> Throughout my schooling years, I discovered my interests in combining my two passions of art and science.\n    This was a core theme of my thesis project, as my background education from my dual degree in Cognitive Neuroscience and Art helped me\n    to approach the goal of this project from both an artistic angle, understanding how visuals can impact audiences, as well as a \n    psychological/biological angle, understanding the ways in which sensorial tools aid in attention and engagement of young and autistic audiences.</p>\n\n    {/* ==== EDIT ABOVE THIS LINE ==== */}\n\n  </div>\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// worked with the rabbi to developed visual \n    //symbols to represent each of the prayers in the Shabbat in order to guide the members \n    //with ASD through the ceremony.
