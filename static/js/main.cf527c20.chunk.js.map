The topic of this project involved research of 1) how to make the most effective\n    visual symbols for their intended audience, 2) user experience and user testing, 3) sensorial tools in aiding engagement of individuals on the Autism spectrum, \n    as well as pre-verbal aged children.</p>\n\n<div className=\"imgs max300\">\n        <div>\n            <img \n                src={require('../assets/capstone/aboutTS/templeOutside.jpg')} \n                onClick={props.open}\n            />\n            <p>Temple Sinai, of Pittsburgh, PA</p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <img \n                src={require('../assets/capstone/aboutTS/templeInside.jpg')} \n                onClick={props.open}\n            />\n            <p>Temple Sinai's prayer room</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n        \n    <p>Temple Sinai in Pittsburgh, PA is a Jewish temple that works to be inclusive of all of its members. \n    One way in which they pursue this is by holding their Mostly Musical Shabbat, a monthly prayer ceremony \n    that utilizes the sensorial tools of singing and listening to music in order to best involve the temple \n    members with sensory needs, such as young audiences or those on the Autism spectrum. Sensorial tools such as these\n    have been shown to be especially beneficial to those with Autism Spectrum Disorder as involving different \n    senses is known to help these individuals engage attention.</p>\n\n<div className=\"imgs max300\">\n        <div>\n            <img \n                src={require('../assets/capstone/aboutTS/flyerMMS.jpg')} \n                onClick={props.open}\n            />\n            <p>Flyer for \"Mostly Musical Shabbat\"</p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <img \n                src={require('../assets/capstone/aboutTS/demoMMS.jpg')} \n                onClick={props.open}\n            />\n            <p>A \"Mostly Musical Shabbat\" ceremony</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n        \n    <p>Temple Sinai’s rabbi and I connected when we agreed to collaborate on this Mostly Musical Shabbat. We discussed\n    incorporating additional sensorial elements in the shabbat, and this became the topic for which I dedicated my undergraduate thesis project. \n    To supplement the musical sensorial elements that the temple was already incorporating, I produced, tested, and iterated various \n    visual and interactive products to help maintain involvement during the ceremony from our target audiences.</p>\n\n\n\n\n    <h2> Ideation</h2>\n\n    <p> I met with the rabbi to first discuss the flow of the shabbat ceremony. We determined that the items needed were:\n    1) a \"visual schedule\" to help the audience members be aware of the overall flow and duration of the shabbat, \n    and 2) some form of tactile interactive object for members to engage with as the ceremony was proceeding.</p>\n\n    <p> The rabbi and I spliced the ceremony's flow into four main sections, and I learned from the rabbi the \n    contents and meanings of each prayer within these four ceremony sections. Separately, I continued my literature review \n    research on how to make effective symbols, and began to illustrate symbols to represent each shabbat prayer. \n    The rabbi and I iterated over the prayers' symbol library until we felt content with them.</p>\n\n<div className=\"imgs max300\">\n        <div>\n            <img \n                src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/iconExamples.jpg')} \n                onClick={props.open}\n            />\n            <p>Select example icons</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\n    <h2> Process</h2>\n\n    <p> Once the symbol library was complete, I began the first iterations of the two products. The \"visual schedule\" \n    was expressed as a 6-foot-tall banner to sit on the stage where the rabbi would be leading the ceremony. This banner \n    was used to denote the four ceremony sections, as well as all of the prayers in each section.</p>\n\n<div className=\"imgs max400\">\n        <div>\n            <img \n                src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/bannerStageOG.jpg')} \n                onClick={props.open}\n            />\n            <p>Banner on stage at Temple Sinai</p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <img \n                src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/banner.jpg')} \n                onClick={props.open}\n            />\n            <p>Banner, digital</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n    <p> The second product was an interactive sticker sheet, with one of each prayer icon printed on the stickers. The intended use of this\n    product was to follow along with each prayer, helping with engagement of the target audneice to comprehend: 1) the duration of the \n    ceremony, 2) which prayer was currently happening, and 3) the overall topic of the current prayer.</p>\n\n    <p>My first iteration of this product began as a \"bookmark\" to be placed in each audience member's torah book. \n    The bookmark had black and white labelled versions of each prayer, and the corresponding stickers were intended to be applied over \n    each prayer as it was occurring. I created this bookmark by designing and printing out sheets with all four ceremony\n    sections, and folding these sheets to expose only one section of the ceremony at a time. Each of these four sections were the same\n    as those denoted on the visual schedule on the temple's stage.</p>\n\n<Slide easing=\"ease\" duration={3000} className=\"slides max400\">\n        <div className=\"slide\">\n            <div style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${require('../assets/capstone/versions/1/print1.jpg')})` }} >\n                <label><span>Bookmark, unfolded</span></label>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"slide\">\n            <div style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/singleStickers.jpg')})` }} >\n                <label><span>Accompanying sticker sheet</span></label>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </Slide>\n\n    <p>After receiving user feedback after the ceremony, I began planning my next iterations. Both the rabbi and the patrons expressed\n    great satisfaction with the banner. The bookmark, however, was not clear enough as to what interaction was expected to take place. Thus,\n    I created a larger bookmark with the stickers already on the bookmark, next to where the stickers should be place. I also included \n    on the bookmark more directions, such as numbering the order of the four ceremony sections as well as instructions on how to place the stickers.\n    This iteration can be viewed below.</p>\n\n<Slide easing=\"ease\" duration={3000} className=\"slides max400\">\n        <div className=\"slide\">\n            <div style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${require('../assets/capstone/versions/2/print1.jpg')})` }} >\n                <label><span>Front side</span></label>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"slide\">\n            <div style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${require('../assets/capstone/versions/2/print2.jpg')})` }} >\n                <label><span>Back side</span></label>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </Slide>\n\n    <div className=\"imgs max300 centered\">\n        <div>\n            <img \n                src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/2/1.jpeg')} \n                onClick={props.open}\n            />\n            <p>Pick-up spot before entering</p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <img \n                src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/2/2.jpeg')} \n                onClick={props.open}\n            />\n            <p>Physical demonstration</p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <img \n                src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/2/4.jpeg')} \n                onClick={props.open}\n            />\n            <p>Physical demonstration</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n        \n\n    <p>I continued this process of user testing and user feedback for the remainder of my semester, until I came upon the final idea of\n    a \"sticker book\", in place of the bookmark idea. I was guided to this idea by the continued user feedback, as this seemed to be\n    the most intuitive format to express the progession of several different sections of the ceremony.</p>\n\n    <p>This book was separated by: 1) a cover image to express the topic of the book, 2) an instruction page to express the intended use, \n    3) one page per each section of the ceremony, and 4) a sheet of stickers, in order, for each prayer that would occur.</p>\n \n    <Slide easing=\"ease\" duration={3000} className=\"slides max400\">\n        <div className=\"slide\">\n            <div style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/print1.jpg')})` }} >\n                <label><span>Front cover</span></label>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"slide\">\n            <div style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/print2.jpg')})` }} >\n                <label><span>Instruction page</span></label>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"slide\">\n            <div style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/print3.jpg')})` }} >\n                <label><span>Page 1</span></label>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"slide\">\n            <div style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/print4.jpg')})` }} >\n                <label><span>Page 2</span></label>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"slide\">\n            <div style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/print5.jpg')})` }} >\n                <label><span>Page 3</span></label>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"slide\">\n            <div style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/print6.jpg')})` }} >\n                <label><span>Page 4</span></label>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"slide\">\n            <div style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/print7.jpg')})` }} >\n                <label><span>Back cover</span></label>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"slide\">\n            <div style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/singleStickers.jpg')})` }} >\n                <label><span>Accompanying sticker sheet</span></label>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </Slide>\n    \n    <div className=\"imgs max300 centered\">\n        <div>\n            <img \n                src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/tableHandout.jpeg')} \n                onClick={props.open}\n            />\n            <p>Pick-up spot before entering</p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <img \n                src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/bookPile.jpeg')} \n                onClick={props.open}\n            />\n            <p>Physical books</p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <img \n                src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/demoSticker.jpeg')} \n                onClick={props.open}\n            />\n            <p>Physical book demonstration</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>  \n\n    <p>I was happy to see that this book had very positive effects at its final test run.

During this final test ceremony, \n    children who had not received the book were noticing others enjoying it and ran to the lobby get their own book. I actually ran out of my\n    supply of books. After the ceremony, parents came over to me thrilled at how engaged their young children remained during the entire ceremony, and requested that this be applied to other events\n    as well. In addition, a boardmember of the Women of Reform Judaism (WRJ) requested that I share this product with the 800 temples \n    involved in her organization, as well as produce such content for similar audiences in other environments such as other ceremonies as well as Hebrew school.</p>\n\n\n\n\n    <div className=\"imgs max300\">\n       \n        <div>\n            <img \n                src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/girl.jpeg')} \n                onClick={props.open}\n            />\n            <p>A young temple member and her grandmother using the sticker book</p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <img \n                src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/4/bannerStageOG.jpg')} \n                onClick={props.open}\n            />\n            <p>Banner in use during ceremony</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n    <h2> Conclusion</h2>\n\n    <p> Throughout my schooling years, I discovered my interests in combining my two passions of art and science.\n    This was a core theme of my thesis project, as my background education from my dual degree in Cognitive Neuroscience and Art helped me\n    to approach the goal of this project from both an artistic angle, understanding how visuals can impact audiences, as well as \n    psychological and biological angles, understanding the ways in which sensorial tools aid in attention and engagement of young and autistic audiences. As mentioned above, the sticker book and icon banner evolved into very effective tools for helping to engage the target audience after implementing the data collected from the rounds of user feedback, and I am pleased with the results of this project.</p>\n\n    <div className=\"imgs max700\">\n       \n        <div>\n            <img \n                src={require('../assets/capstone/versions/capstonePresentation/2.jpeg')} \n                data-skip-gallery\n            />\n            <p>Presenting the project and its various progressing products at Carnegie Mellon's \"Meeting of the Minds\" 2017 event</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    {/* ==== EDIT ABOVE THIS LINE ==== */}\n\n  </div>\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// worked with the rabbi to developed visual \n    //symbols to represent each of the prayers in the Shabbat in order to guide the members \n    //with ASD through the ceremony.

This initiative aims to involve more creative-minded people on our educational website, enlisting their creativity to produce varying types of explanations of lessons (such as videos, music, art, etc.)</p>\n\n    <p>I began by designing a few different mock-ups of the poster that would be shared. The designs were to fit in with the current Expii branding identity - one that is clean and simple - but could also slightly stray from our current branding identity in the sense that this project is to attract more creativity-oriented minds. Thus, my designs ranged in feeling - from playful and creative, to modern and intriguing.</p>\n    \n    <div className=\"imgs max700\">\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/graphicDesign/spark/inspo.png')} data-skip-gallery/>\n            <p>Inspiration board</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"imgs max700\">\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/graphicDesign/spark/mockups.png')} data-skip-gallery/>\n            <p>My design mockups</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <p>I continued going in the direction of a modern and intriguing feeling for the branding, as this fits best with the Expii brand, as well as our current goal to attract professionals within their respective creative fields. The first two designs shown above might be revisited when we begin expanding this initiative to be targeted at younger audiences, as these designs feel more playful.</p>\n\n    <p>Given this decision, I began designing a slick and crisp branding logo for Project Spark, shown below. I still wanted to incorporate a feeling of excitement, thus I designed the sparkler text effect.</p>\n\n    <div className=\"imgs max500\">\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/graphicDesign/spark/logo.png')} data-skip-gallery/>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <p>I designed the creative field icons (seen at the bottom of the below poster) in order to still maintain some of the fun aspects of my previous designs, as well as give the viewer some information about the types of content for which Project Spark is aiming. Below is my final design for the Project Spark poster.</p>\n\n    <div className=\"imgs max700\">\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/graphicDesign/spark/flyer.png')} data-skip-gallery/>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    \n    <p>Finally, I designed the Project Spark webpage to go on Expii’s site. Using the branding identity I had just established for Project Spark, I designed a scrolling-based web page with information on what the project is, as well as how to apply.</p>\n\n    <div className=\"imgs max700\">\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/graphicDesign/spark/computerMockup.png')} data-skip-gallery/>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <p>You can view the rest of this web design at <a href=\"https://www.expii.com/spark\" target=\"_blank\">expii.com/spark</a></p>\n\n    <p>My next goal for this branding is to expand upon it - to add to the feeling of modernity and excitement.

The company had this design printed on a bulk order of \n    shirts, and we all wore it at the 2017 ALS walk to represent \"Team Tobii Dynavox\".</p>\n\n    <div className=\"imgs max600\">\n        <div>\n            <img src={require('../assets/graphicDesign/tobiiShirt/finalDesign.png')} data-skip-gallery/>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    \n    {/* ==== EDIT ABOVE THIS LINE ==== */}\n\n  </div>\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// worked with the rabbi to developed visual \n    //symbols to represent each of the prayers in the Shabbat in order to guide the members \n    //with ASD through the ceremony.

In 2017, I completed an interdisciplinary degree from Carnegie Mellon University in Art and Cognitive Neuroscience, a blend of my passion for both the arts and academia. My passion is to use art as a medium for communication or education, with a personal graphics style focused on achieving a lively, engaging, and compelling impact. Upon discovering Reedsy, I was so happy to learn about your product and mission, both of which I believe in strongly. I also was happily surprised to learn that Savannah Cordova works at your company; I was Art Director and she was Staff Writer of Verde Magazine, our high school news magazine. What a great coincidence that after all of these years we might have the opportunity to collaborate again, and on such a meaningful tool that brings the power of creative collaboration and self-publishing to so many users around the world.</p>\n\n<p>I am an accomplished illustrator, and hope to grow my career and enhance my skills with Reedsy. One of my strongest skills is producing visuals that turn complex ideas into fun and easy to digest content, and I know I could offer this to Reedsy’s blog posts, social media, newsletters, and ads. I have experience doing so with: illustrating covers and internal graphics for news magazine Verde Magazine; illustrating Picture Communication Symbols (PCS) and literacy-oriented children’s books at health-tech company Tobii Dynavox; creating for my undergraduate thesis a diverse communication symbol library for children and sensory sensitive individuals at Temple Sinai Pittsburgh; illustrating children’s books and animating videos to explain medical topics at children’s healthcare company Jumo Health; and creating engaging illustrations and short animations to pair with math and science content at ed-tech company Expii. I enjoyed my experience with each of these companies because I contributed to content that helped and compelled others, similar to Reedsy’s product and brand! In addition to the above, I have experience illustrating and animating for social media and marketing campaigns. In all of my professional roles, I excel at maintaining style and branding standards, produce high quality content, and have excellent attention to detail.</p>\n\n<p>I love to collaborate and always welcome feedback. I believe in Reedsy’s mission and would be thrilled to join such a driven, diverse, and creative team. As mentioned in the “Bonus Points” section of your job listing, my favorite color actually really is #12a4e2! Or as I called it growing up, “Cinderella Blue”, which can be seen in my personal logo. I am eager to be a hardworking addition to your team, and believe this would be a great fit!</p>\n\n<p>Please find my résumé below for your review, and I would be happy to discuss my skills and experiences further.
